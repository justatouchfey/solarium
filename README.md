Solarium: A Steempunk Mystery Visual Novel
========================================================

Thank you for taking interest in this project! 

Solarium will be a mystery visual novel, built using Ren'Py, that uses in-depth character studies, rich visuals, timed events, and randomization to seamlessly provide hours of entertainment and introduce players to the intricate world of the Steempunk game as well as the Steemit blockchain. It will use player-created content as the basis for its characters and a variety of mechanics such as hidden objects, branching narratives, and more to expand on and celebrate the Steempunk storyline.

The game will be playable without participation in the STEEMPUNK-NET project, but is also meant to be a way for current players to get more into the universe and enjoy more interactivity with the pre-existing game. (https://github.com/pcsg/steempunknet)

# Story
Oona Neapolis, a member of a prestigious Aristocratic family and prolific inventor, has contacted you, a fellow Clockwork Fighter, as a bounty hunter to recover some of her creations that have gone missing. Neapolis is known as the brain behind the popular Clockwork Companions, new techno-organic pets that her family wishes the Ultima Corp to approve as fighting companions for their fighters in the Clockwork Arena. The Neapolis family believes that potentially a rival company has stolen the work in an attempt to beat them to the market. To gain your reward, you must investigate the crime scene, get to know the characters, and search various locations in the city for clues. Stay on your guard though. The thief may not take too kindly to you trying to track them down and as seasoned Clockwork Fighters all of your suspects have the brains and the brawn to take you out of the running for good.

# Technical Details
At the time of writing, Solarium is imagined as approximately 2-3 hours of gameplay, which on average translates to about 3-5 months of work on a visual novel, depending on the developer. It will use the Ren’py game engine and will be released on GitHub as an opensource work. The main storyline will be created by Ciel/@justatouchfey with input from interested community members. Players of the Steempunk game will be invited to help craft the look and personality of supporting characters and events that will determine the outcome of the game.


Getting Started
========================================================
This game runs on the open-source Ren'Py (https://www.renpy.org) software. To edit the files or preview the the test versions, you must have that software installed on your computer. Download the project files and put them in the renpy sdk folder in a folder called "Solarium". It should be at the same level as the tutorial folder and the_question folder, which are the two introduction projects that the software automatically provides for new developers. You should see "Solarium" now available under "Projects" when you open up the Ren'Py program

Once completed, the game will run standalone without the developers software. If you are interested in understanding more how the game is programmed, please see the Ren'Py online documentation (https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/).

This game is based in the STEEMPUNK-NET (https://www.steempunk.net) universe. Steempunk is a browser extension that runs a MMORPG based on the Steem blockchain, using Steemit.com. All characters will be created by Steempunk players. While playable without participation in the STEEMPUNK-NET project, this game is meant to be a way for players to get more into the universe and enjoy more interactivity with the pre-existing game.
